# BASIC-PHP-BLOG


This is a basic php blog integrated with mysql database.

**Functionalities**

User can add posts containing title, author name, blog writeup and a feature image. There is also options of editing and deleting the posts.

**What did I learn?**

I went through the basics of mysql that I can do with php. Fetching data from the database made me notice about a number of ways to do so.
This made the learning process more interesting and I was so much pumped up to use a new way to fetch data every time.

**Realization**

Mysql is quite interesting to work with and I would like to explore it more.
